KREWE OF VAPORWAVE UNVEILS “#SMARTYOURCITY” CAMPAIGN WITH 5G TOWER ACTIVATION
    </head>
    <p>
December Installations at Jazz Museum, Supernova on the Lafitte Greenway, LUNA Fête; Gala scheduled for 2/2/23 
        </p>
        <p>
The Virtual Krewe of Vaporwave placed pairs of bright and visible stickers on new 5G towers in the French Quarter. 
        </p>
        <p>
The first sticker, a high-grade, weatherproof ISO radiation warning sticker placed at eye level, is identical to radiation stickers that were placed by installation professionals high up on the antennas, far out of public view. 
        </p>
        <p>
The second sticker, a cheap, thermal-printed sticker of a matching yellow, contains the krewe’s trademark wit and a link back to their theme for this year’s Mardi Gras: “Smart Your City.” These stickers are intended to be quickly washed away by the weather, leaving only the ISO sticker to remain for posterity. 
        </p>
        <p>
The Krewe of Vaporwave takes no official opinion on 5G, except that it doesn’t work all that well as a service and some of the towers are falling apart already and they’re ugly. 
        </p>
        <p>
The krewe promises more acts of public service that contrast the naive carpetbaggery of techno-futurism with the reality of our city’s crumbling public infrastructure. 
        </p>
        <p>
December is a public-facing month for the Krewe of Vaporwave, as they play integral parts in the city’s three consecutive weekends of publicly-funded, secular lights festivals. This past weekend at the Jazz Museum’s annual Improvisations Gala, the Krewe performed an original piece entitled "We Made an AI Listen to 1000 Hours of Contemporary Music and Then We Asked It How It Was Feeling” on seven bespoke, DIY electronic instruments housed inside of discarded home furniture. Next weekend they will assume their yearly duties lending labor, technical expertise, and original art to Supernova on the Lafitte Greenway. On December 15-18, they will participate in their 5th straight LUNA Fête with a massive installation entitled “You Can’t Spell ‘Costume’ Without ‘E-Custom,” a study in the fraught world of online identity. 
        </p>
        <p>
In contrast to other krewes that charge membership dues, Krewe of Vaporwave members work paid AV gigs throughout the year to fund their Mardi Gras celebrations. This year’s “Smart Your City” Fundraising Gala Benefit Event will be held at Margaret Place on February 2, 2023.
