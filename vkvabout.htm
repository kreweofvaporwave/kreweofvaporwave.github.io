<!--The Virtual Krewe of Vaporwave (VKV), New Orleans’ first and only virtual Mardi Gras krewe, is a collective of artists, hackers, breakers, thinkers, and coders from New Orleans and the internet. 

<br><p>Each Carnival since its founding in 2016, VKV has released a Virtual Parade - an online Mardi Gras celebration that takes a slightly different form each year. In February 2016, VKV streamed the world’s first online Mardi Gras Parade on twitch.tv, spamming the comments sections with “throws.” In 2017, VKV’s parade rolled in an online, multiplayer video game environment. The 2018 Virtual Parade took the form of a retro-style “dungeon crawler” video game, playable directly from any internet browser.</p>

<br><p>VKV’s real-world footprint has exploded since its first live event, the 2017 IRL BALL, headlined by social media pioneer @lilinternet. That same spring, VKV launched JAZZ CUP, an annual Jazz Fest pool party. 2018’s JAZZ CUP drew over 400 people to the Drifter Hotel. </p>

<br><p>In 2018, VKV transformed the Music Box Village into a wild multimedia satire of the 1984 World’s Fair. THE WORLD’S UNFAIR drew over 600 paid revelers and featured headliner Win Butler of Arcade Fire, as well as an all-star cast of local performers, independent multimedia artists, software engineers, gamers, and cryptocurrency consultants.</p>

<br><p>Membership in VKV is pseudonymous, and individual members are encouraged to keep the details of their membership a secret. The krewe has received extensive press coverage, garnering features in Gizmodo, the New Orleans Advocate, Gambit Weekly, and MySplitMilk. VKV has appeared many times on local radio stations WWOZ, WHIV, WTUL, and WRBH.</p>
